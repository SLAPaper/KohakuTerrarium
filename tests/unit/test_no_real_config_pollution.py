"""Regression guard: no test ever writes to the operator's real config.

The whole suite runs with ``KT_CONFIG_DIR`` redirected to a per-test
``tmp_path`` via the autouse fixture in ``tests/conftest.py``.  This
file is a separate, last-resort check: snapshot the *content* of
``~/.kohakuterrarium/`` at module import and fail the test if any
file's content changed during the test run.

A failure here usually means a new test introduced a save / write
path that resolves through an absolute ``Path.home()`` lookup instead
of ``config_dir()`` — for example the deprecated
``monkeypatch.setattr(mod, "PROFILES_PATH", …)`` seam that stopped
working when the live read/write path moved to ``_profiles_path()``.

**Why we compare content hashes, not mtime/size**: when the operator
has KohakuTerrarium running locally (browser tab, desktop app) it may
re-write identical content into files like ``ui_prefs.json`` every
few seconds (frontend polling save_prefs with no changes). That
bumps the mtime but doesn't change the bytes — and it's not a test
leak. A real test leak shows up as a content drift (added key,
modified value, new file). We compare SHA-256 of each file's bytes
to keep the guard tight while ignoring no-op external rewrites.
